## ✨ What This Project Is
This is not just a static webpage. It is a **demonstration of a website generator I built**.
- **Input:** A user provides a company name and description.
- **Output:** The tool returns a complete, styled HTML landing page (like the "Andela" page you see in the demo).
- **Purpose:** To automate and simplify website creation for small businesses.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- The core generator uses **JavaScript** to template and format HTML/CSS.
- The example output is deployed as a static site via **GitHub Pages**.
- The project showcases skills in **product development, DOM manipulation, and automated content generation**.

## 🎯 Why I Built This
To solve a real problem: creating a professional web presence should be fast and accessible. This tool reduces that process from hours to seconds.
